Welcome to Fluency

This GitHub is the collection of code to leverage the Fluency's data streaming operating system. 

## What is Ingext
Fluency is a Streaming Analytics System designed to support the processes of a Security Operations Center. Operators define data source and data sinks. Then they move the data from a source to a sink by sending through pipe processes. These processors transform, parse, enrich, and route the records.

Fluency is designed to be a structured way to ingress data into a datastore, such as an S3 bucket or a SIEM. It is high speed; in that it processes twenty (20) times the speed of scripts or Lambdas. It is also 120 times more efficient in startup and execution than a Lambda, as it is always on and ready to process. Lastly, this is a streaming system. Ingext focuses on event driven movement of data (pushing), using pulling only when communicating this external data sources.
